# Capability Bus Platform

Coordination and release-governance project for:

- `capability-bus-core`
- `capability-bus-official-ui`

This repository contains the overall roadmap, contract-freeze gates, compatibility records, review checklists, and cross-project release evidence. It is not a runtime dependency and contains no Core or UI implementation.

## Current status

**CORE T0 AUDIT COMPLETE — WAITING FOR HUMAN REVIEW**

The user approved the plan and architecture under commit `ddcfa0974637bbdd9a91d93b87f0a7f983eda8af` and authorized Core T0 only. See [the scoped approval record](docs/governance/t0-preparation-authorization.md) and [the verified T0 human review report](docs/reviews/core-t0-human-review.md). T0 has stopped for human review; T1/T2 and UI business implementation remain unauthorized. UI stays in U0.

## Required reading

1. `docs/planning/master-development-plan.md`
2. `docs/governance/orchestration-protocol.md`

## Architecture diagrams

- `docs/architecture/everything-as-plugin-v2.1-original-reference.drawio`: unchanged original architectural-intent reference; not an implementation contract.
- `docs/architecture/capability-bus-alpha-optimized-topology.drawio`: implementation topology aligned with the current Core Alpha and Official UI Plugin design baselines.
- `docs/architecture/README.md`: provenance, authority and diagram change rules.
